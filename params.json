{"name":"Panagiks.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nHello! I'm Panagiotis Kolokotronis , a Computer Science and Informatics student. I love to code, but I also love to get my hands dirty from time to time with some hardware. I speak C , C ++ and Java fluently (sorry for the pun). Lately, I've been experimenting with HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python and C#. On the dark side (you know, the hardwares) I'm interested in the Internet of Things, initially getting into the scheme with Arduino and later going by the flag of Microsoft IoT Developer.\r\n\r\nI usually go by the name panagiks and some other times by the name Lonas. You can always find me at:\r\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Panagiks)\r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/panagiks)\r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/panagiks)\r\n\r\nMy other interests involve Game Development (currently developing a mobile game on Unity), Computer networks and Network Security and last but not least 3D Modelling and Animation.\r\n\r\nSo what are you doing again ? Oh right, about that. In March 2014, I co-founded [JustAddCoffee](http://JustAddCoffee.org) a gaming-tech site in which unfortunately I haven't devoted as much time as I wanted. Next on, I participated in ACM's students Chapter project of creating a video game , initially as a Modeller / Animator and later on took the Social Media / Page Management of the project. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
